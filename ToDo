ToDo and features to think about

acronym:
 * Possibility: Replace my "parsing" with Beautiful Soup? Extra dep
 * Possibility: Change http.client with urllib2 or httplib2 for direct redirect (301) support? Extra dep in case of httplib2 which seems better

confback:
 * Some configs are tracked via an own git repo (canto, conkyscripts, e.g.). Should they removed or remain as alternative backup system?

udict:
  * Possibility: BeautifulSoup. Would it make extremly easy (Seach for content of <div class='word'> and <div class='definition'> and <div class='example'>)
 * Examples parsing
 * If there was a redirect: Print the relinked entry and not INPUT
