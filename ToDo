ToDo and features to think about

acronym:
 * Possibility: Change http.client with urllib2 or httplib2 for direct redirect (301) support? Extra dep in case of httplib2 which seems better
 * Remove "middle step"

confback:
 * Some configs are tracked via an own git repo (canto, conkyscripts, e.g.). Should they removed or remain as alternative backup system?

udict:
 * Examples parsing
 * If there was a redirect: Print the relinked entry and not INPUT
 * Remove "middle step"
