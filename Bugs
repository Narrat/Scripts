acronym:
 * Darstellung: & wird zu &amp;
 * meaning = re.findall(...) fails for explanations with more than one upper-case in the first word (example: RTFW)

udict:
 * Darstellungsproblem wie bei acronym & , " (&quot) etc
 * Improve Meaning parsing: Beginning with a lower-case chars fails to be detected
 * Improve Meaning parsing: explanations with newlines  aren't correctly handled
 * Improve Meaning parsing: References to others words aren't filtered
 * Improve Meaning parsing: other html-tags aren't filtered (example atta girl)
 * Example Fnord --> one result --> group is wrong, as only one result is found --> AttributeError

	Traceback (most recent call last):
